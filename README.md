# SortingAlgorithms

This is a C++ implementation of various sorting algorithms, to obeserve their runtime and memory usage for sorting an unsorted
array of random integers. Their performance is also tested on an already sorted array.

To test, run `./eval <size of array>`. For example, `./eval 10000`
